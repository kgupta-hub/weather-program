# weather-program
This program uses Python and the requests library to fetch weather data from the given API. It then provides the user with options to get the weather, wind speed, or pressure for a specific date. The program will run until the user chooses to exit.

Please make sure to replace "https://api.example.com/weather/london" with the actual API endpoint for the hourly weather forecast in London.

Remember to set up a virtual environment, install the requests library, and execute the program using Python.
